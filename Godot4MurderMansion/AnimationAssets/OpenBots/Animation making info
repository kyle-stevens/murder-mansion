Lets build some animation libraries!

The OpenBot and OpenDog models are CC0 (I made them just now), and the metarig/game rig is GPL 3.0 license from this project.

They should be perfectly compatible with Godot's bone remapping features.

The OpenBot's skeleton should match very similarly to the Mixamo skeleton. This means animations made with either
should work decently across models.

Feel free to use the the openbot.blend files to pose/animation and create animations.
Import them into Godot using the bonemap file.
'Save As' your animation libraries
And share those libararies back here so we can all benefit.
